Instructions
================================================================
Design an object model for a given domain. Use (demonstrate the ability to work with):
	- Classes (abstract classes – if possible)
	- Interfaces
	- Inheritance,
	- Polymorphism,
	- Encapsulation,
	- Collections.

Each class methods and variables must have a sense and be informative.
 It is good to think about exactly what classes are needed in the solution. 
Inheritance should be used only when it makes sense. Classes must be properly 
laid out in packages. Working with the an user’s console menu should be minimal 
(only necessary data input, display only what is asked in the problem).
 The task is a domain area where you have to allocate the necessary hierarchy 
of classes and to implement it with the features of OOP (using inheritance,
 if necessary or realizing interfaces). Each class must have fields and methods that you consider necessary.
 The program should create objects of different classes in the selected domain, combine them in any set of 
objects (use the collection). As a rule, the task requires to perform some action on the objects in a collection of objects
 based on specified criteria.

Tasks 
================================================================
1. I have a pizza shop, which offers a Standard or Soft base. It also offers a selection of toppings from Tomato,  corn, mushrooms.
 Customers can choose one base and many toppings. The cost of the pizza is the cost of the base plus the cost of the selected toppings. 
Write code to represent this model in an Object-Oriented approach and calculate the cost of a given pizza. 

2. A bouquet consists of different types of flowers, Roses, Jasmines, Lilys etc. Consider a rose costs 1$, jasmine costs 2$, 
Lily costs 3$.
 The cost of the bouquet is the sum of the cost of the flowers in it.  Use the object-oriented approach to design the above 
situation and write a utility method to calculate the cost of the given bouquet. 

3. New Year's gift. Identify the hierarchy of chocolates and other sweets. Create multiple objects of sweets. 
Collect children's gift to define total weight. Sort the chocolates in a gift by one of the options. 
Find candies in the gift corresponding to a predetermined range of options. 

4. In a home, there are multiple appliances. Each appliance consumes a certain amount of power when “Switch on”. 
eg: Home can have FAN, Light, TV, Laptop, etc. when "Switch on" they consume FAN-1 unit, Light - 2 units, TV-3 units etc power.
 Create a method to calculate the amount of power consumption at any given point (current load). 
Sort the devices in an apartment by one of (any) the parameters.
